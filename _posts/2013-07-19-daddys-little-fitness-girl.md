## JULIE'S STORY

Kamen Yotov is one of those people who could go out and run a marathon without "really" training. A Brooklyn Bridge Boot Camp veteran and participant of Ariane Hundt's Slim and Strong program, his daughter Julie began emulating his fitness activities when she was just 5 years old.

Says Julie, now 9 years old:

<blockquote>
I was 5 when I did my first race. At first I didn't like it. But I continued to try. I then ran my first mile with my father, then started to run 5Ks. Now I love it.
</blockquote>

Today, it is Julie who provides Kamen with motivation. Kamen says:

<blockquote>
I was about to finish the IronMan last weekend. I was tired and feeling like giving up. But that's not the example I want to set for my daughter.
</blockquote>

Julie gave her dad loving support by running by his side for the last 4-miles of the race. For Kamen and Julie, their workout relationship started early on and continues to grow as she makes appearances with him at some of his favorite outdoor workout classes in New York City. At first it's off-putting to see such a young person in a class full of adults. But Julie's fitness ability and passion for exercise comes across quickly and then you realize that this little girl is truly special... and her dad is seriously lucky.

It's the type of father-daughter relationship you envy as an observing outsider--because it's so darn cute and because you can tell their shared interest makes them a happy family.
