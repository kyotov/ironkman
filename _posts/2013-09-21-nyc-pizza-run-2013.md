## TimeOut New York

The NYC Pizza Run premise is simple: Chow three slices of pizza while running 2.25 miles through the East Village.

By Sarah Theeboom Mon Sep 23 2013 

Athletes carbo-loaded mid-race at the third annual NYC Pizza Run on Saturday, September 21, stopping to eat three slices of pizza while running 2.25 miles. The aerobic pig-out benefits the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. If you've got a sweet tooth, start training for the NYC Cupcake Run on October 19.

<blockquote>
Kamen Yotov and Miriam Wisekind took the men’s and women’s titles handedly. Both squirted water between bites to aid the pizza’s path down their throats – a strategy not all knew to take advantage of.
